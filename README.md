# Ski Log Database

This ski log database is designed for teams and athletes that want to keep track of their ski fleet and historical performance for easy reference access and ski sticker creation.


## Features

User interaction points are primarily on mobile devices, as phones are the most accessible devices when training, racing, and traveling.

The athlete can ...

1) add new skis and update the information,
2) log ski performance for testing and racing sessions, and
3) look up the information easily by scanning a code on the ski.

In addition, the system should generate pre-formatted ski stickers including crucial ski information and a QR or barcode.

## Design

The system consists of the following parts:
- Database (MariaDB)
- Python Backend
- Web-Framework (TBD)
